This includes, transcription, rating, correcting errors, translation, moderation and many others.</p><p>There are many tasks available on these platforms and some jobs pay rather well too. You can do this full-time or amongst other things.</p><p>It gives you the flexibility to work whenever is convenient for you and allows you to fit things around personal commitments, studying, and your main job.</p><p>However, one thing to bear in mind is that there will always be people who work slower or faster than others and this can affect how much money you earn from the job.</p><p><strong>Some tips:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Make sure to properly read the guidelines.</strong></li><li><strong>Make sure you complete tasks accurately.</strong> Some platforms are stricter about this than others.</li><li><strong>Do not speed on tasks.</strong> This can result in being disqualified.</li><li><strong>There can be a delay until you get paid.</strong> Some tasks pay when the whole project is completed and others on a fixed schedule.</li></ul><p><strong>Why do companies use crowdsourcing?</strong></p><p>Microwork allows companies to split up larger projects by delegating small tasks to independent contractors. This provides many opportunities for workers contribute to projects that traditionally might have been out of their reach.</p><p>The same holds true for companies looking for ways to expand their markets. They can crowdsource their way into new markets by reaching out to a network of independent workers to build their brand in new sectors and countries.</p><p>As the old clich√© says: a network is only as strong as its weakest link. With crowdsourcing, companies can gain new perspectives and create new possibilities.</p><p>In order to save you time, I&#039;ve put together some of the best and most trustworthy crowdworking sites available right now.</p><p><em><strong>Disclaimer: This site contains affiliate links at no cost to you.
