The concept is based on the premise that individuals/crowds can generate capital to fund an idea, a person or a cause they believe in, as long as they can reach a defined goal. Typically, the more money raised, the better the chances of success.</span></span></p><p><span style="background-color: white"><span style="color: #212529">This offers retail investors the chance to invest in startups that could potentially become huge. Image investing in a company like Tesla in its early days. However, be aware that there is risk involved by doing this. It's possible that the companies could fail or that they never go public limiting your ability to gain anything in return for your investment.</span></span></p><p><span style="background-color: white;color: #212529;font-size: 16px">These sites are all web-based crowdfunding platforms that connect companies and investors through a crowdfunding marketplace. This means you don’t need to create an individual business account and you don’t need to use a broker or investment adviser to find and fund your own deals.</span></p><p><span style="color: #212529"><span style="background-color: white">In order to save you time and effort I have created a list of some of the best equity crowdfunding sites currently available.</span></span></p><div><i><b>Disclaimer: Your capital is at risk.
